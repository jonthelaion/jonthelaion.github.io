I attended a 2-day [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop at Macquarie Uni this week over the mid-semester break and while the material itself was at an introductory level, it was a good refresher of topics (Python, UNIX, Git) that I had previously learnt myself. The tricky part now is finding opportunities to actually practice the skills taught because I know that if I don't use it, I'll soon forget it all again.

I also got the sense that MQ's [Data Science and e-Research](https://staff.mq.edu.au/research/strategy-priorities-and-initiatives/data-science-and-eresearch) department is really looking to lift data capability within the university and to create a community of researchers who can develop and share best practices.

Other than the SWC topic material itself, it was also good to get an understanding of the resources that are available to Macquarie staff/researchers/students and other similar events/workshops that they plan on running in the future.
