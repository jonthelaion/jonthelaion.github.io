Learn and be inspired by other peoples’ work, regardless of the field, and remember to put your work out there, in turn, to serve as inspiration for others. Dedicate some time each day to create something – even if it is limited in scope and even if you feel like it sucks. Let your daily creations be stepping stones to your eventual breakthrough.

1. Steal like an artist
  * Creativity often arises through the fusion and amalgamation of existing ideas in new and original fashions.
  * Take inspiration from those whose work speaks to you and remember to pay homage to them in your own works.
2. Always be learning
  * Adopt a continuous learning mindset to broaden the concepts and ideas that you have available to you in your own work.
  * Find the signal within the noise.
  * You can do this in a number of ways:
    * Branching – Study everything there is to know about a particular thinker. Then find three people that the thinker loved, study them and repeat.
    * Classics – Classics have stood the test of time and contain ideas that can be applied even today.
3. Enter new domains
  * Exposure to new domains allows you to connect ideas in new and unique ways.
4. Be more prolific
  * It is widely assumed that there is a trade off between quality and quantity i.e. that to produce better work you need to produce less. However, this is not strictly true – quantity can also lead to quality. There more work you produce, the more practice you have and the more of a chance you have of creating something unique.
  * Edison and Picasso are two examples of this.
5. Give yourself permission to suck
  * Do not get paralysed by the fear of creating work that is not great. Each work you produce is a step towards your breakthrough.
  * Do not let your self-identity be defined simply by the work you produce. Create work that you love and want to make and you will find joy in the process.
6. Embrace constraints
  * It can be daunting facing into the infinite possibilities when you try to create something original.
  * Constraints can help you to get started by forming guard rails to guide you in your work.
7. Develop your ritual
  * The most important step of creativity is actually rolling up your sleeves to produce something.
  * sRituals are the time that you carve out for yourself to dedicate to your craft.
