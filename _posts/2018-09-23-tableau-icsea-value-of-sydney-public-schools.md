A simple side-by-side scatter plot visualisation to explore the ICSEA values (a measure of socio-educational advantage) of public schools in Sydney split by district. For anyone living in Sydney, it is perhaps unsurprising that South Western Sydney has the lowest ICSEA scores on average.

Note that the ICSEA value is not a measure of performance and so it would be quite interesting to explore whether there is any relationship between ICSEA values and school performance in the future.
