I attended a 2-day [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop at Macquarie Uni over the mid-semester break and while the material itself was only at an introductory level, it was a good refresher of topics (Python, UNIX, Git) that I had previously learnt from online resources. The tricky part now is finding opportunities to actually practice the skills taught and then to take things to the next level.

I also got the sense that MQ's [Data Science and e-Research](https://staff.mq.edu.au/research/strategy-priorities-and-initiatives/data-science-and-eresearch) department is really looking to lift data capability within the university and to create a community of researchers who can develop and share best practices. Other than the SWC topic material itself, the instructors gave us a rundown of some of the resources that are available to Macquarie staff/researchers/students (CloudStor, NCI, AWS Pilot, Overleaf, GitHub) and other similar events/workshops that they plan on running in the future.

**Next steps:**

* Attend workshops being run next week Tue/Thu at MQ
* Clean up and upload notes taken during SWC session
* Find a project to work on to practice skills
