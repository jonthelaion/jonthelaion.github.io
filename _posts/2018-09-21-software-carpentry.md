I attended a 2-day [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop at Macquarie Uni over the mid-semester break and while the material itself was only at an introductory level, it was a good refresher of topics (Python, UNIX, Git) that I had previously learnt from online resources. The tricky part now is finding opportunities to actually practice the skills taught and then to take things to the next level.

It also seems like MQ's [Data Science and e-Research](https://staff.mq.edu.au/research/strategy-priorities-and-initiatives/data-science-and-eresearch) department is looking to lift data capability within the university and to foster a community of researchers who can develop and share best practices. Other than the SWC topic material itself, the instructors provided us with a rundown of some of the resources that are available to Macquarie staff/researchers/students (CloudStor, NCI, AWS Pilot, Overleaf) and other events/workshops that they have planned for the future.

**Next steps:**

* Attend workshops being run next week Tue/Thu at MQ
* Clean up and upload notes taken during SWC session
* Find a project to work on to practice skills
