I attended my first data-related conference in May, Tableau’s Data Day Out, and was thoroughly impressed! For those who don’t know, Tableau is a data visualisation software that focuses on facilitating data analysis and communication of insights through the medium of visual perception. It does a great job of this through its intuitive interface and adoption of visualisation best practices; emphasis on iterative development with rapid feedback cycles; and flexible and scalable deployment.

Tableau usage in my workplace is still at its infancy so it was inspiring to see companies who are further along in the journey showcase where they are currently at in terms of Tableau adoption and capability as well as sharing some of lessons learnt from the roadblocks they have overcome along the way.

Some of the sessions which stood out:

## Dr Jason Fox – A Quest Beckons

* Personal blog: [https://www.drjasonfox.com/](https://www.drjasonfox.com/)
* In a time where everyone is always too “busy”, it’s easy to get caught up in “default thinking” and fall back on old methods of solving problems in the name of efficiency.
* We need to feed our curiosity and expose ourselves to new ideas and thoughts to fight against this complacency.
* We should also take a step back and question whether the tried and tested methods are really the best way of solving new problems in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world.
* People feel most engaged and satisfied when they can see that their actions are resulting in meaningful progress.
* Rituals can be thought of as specific time that you carve out from the busyness of our everyday lives in the pursuit of meaningful progress:
  * Daily – What are 3 tasks that can be completed today that will result in meaningful progress?
  * Weekly – What are the things that got in the way of great work this week?
  * Quarterly – What are 3 meaningful projects that you are excited about working towards in this quarter?
* Carve out time each morning to work on the tasks which will bring about meaningful progress. The worst thing to do is to get into a habit of reading and responding to emails first thing in the morning as it causes you to start the day in a reactive mode.
* Each year choose one word to act as a fuzzy beacon.
* **Overall thoughts:** A great speaker with quick witted humour playing on the quirks of introversion. The material is not that different from other motivational speakers, but nevertheless, well presented and I enjoyed every minute of it.

## Greg Lambert – Origin Energy – From Coal and Gas to the Clouds

* Origin Energy started using Tableau as a niche solution by using a small server sitting under a table affectionately named “Betsy”.
* Now Tableau is deployed business wide in conjunction with AWS and is a core asset that is helping over a thousand business users make critical decisions on a daily basis.
* **Overall thoughts:** Dream big and start small.

## Fiona Gordon – Achievement Unlocked: From Rookies to Rockstars – Building Data Literacy Through Gamification

* Fiona Gordon is the Executive Manager Customer Insights & Analytics at CommSec, CBA

* A progress viz can also be designed to measure results and tracking the journey from Rookie to Rockstar.

* **Overall thoughts:** CBA provides great support to their analytics community and is actively taking steps to improve data literacy around the organisation. The Tableau Quest learning/teaching framework that they have developed is something that can be implemented in any organisation.

## Kai-Ming Cheah – Data to the People

* Personal blog: [http://www.visualtooltips.com/](http://www.visualtooltips.com/)
* Westpac has undertaken a journey over the past 4 years to “give data back to the people” by empowering business users to engage and interact with their own data using Tableau.
* Kai’s recounting of their starting point was painfully similar to how things are in my current work place.
* Monthly reports are produced weeks into the new month and management having to put up with the time lag.
* Data requests are sent to select “data” people in the business asking them to analyse some data for x department for y reason. There is very little value-add and the analysis work involves mostly cleaning, joining and summarising data from spreadsheets. The product of this is usually only used once and then discarded.
* A consequence of giving data to the people is that it will inevitably shine a light on fundamental data quality issues e.g. inconsistencies in business rules and processes. Analysts often manually clean up raw data to address these issues before it can be presented in management reporting and hence, the root cause of data quality issues is rarely addressed.
Westpac are now at a stage where they have daily refreshes of the data that business users can check on the go through various mediums.
* **Overall thoughts:** Deploying Tableau successfully across a large organisation is a long journey and will take time. Tableau will shine a light on business rules and processes and help drive remediation of data quality issues.

## Ben Porter – Tableau Centre of Excellence Best Practice

* A Centre of Excellence (COE) involves the following three keys:
  * Managing a stable platform
  * Building creative confidence (bottom up)
  * Changing your culture (top down)
* When designing dashboards, think like a product manager:
  * Focus on the stock functionality of Tableau and then make incremental changes.
  * Think holistically when designing your dashboard and consider what it means for the audience and why they should care.
* Teach everyone design principles
  * Designing with Tableau is an iterative process.
  * Get your executives to draw down using pen and paper or on a whiteboard what they are looking for and how they want to use the dashboard.
  * Good resource: The Big Book of Dashboards
* Teach your creators to steal like an artist.
* Data competencies are critical for success so get to know the stakeholders who manage your data.
* Spend the energy to plan just enough upfront. Planning is important not just for the final plan that comes out of it, but also for the discussion that takes place throughout. A good plan today is better than a perfect plan in the future.
* Embrace the politics of governance and present the right message to the right person:
  * Executives: Top/bottom line
  * Management: Workforce efficiency
  * Creators: Satisfying work
* To create a Tableau community within your organisation you will need to build a COE that can win hearts and minds.
* Be judicious with deployment and prize stakeholder engagement versus organisational importance.
