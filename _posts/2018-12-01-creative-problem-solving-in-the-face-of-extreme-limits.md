When external resources are scare, we have to tap into human ingenuity. Frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value using fewer resources and involves taking what is most abundant to deal with what is scarce.

How to go about adopting frugal innovation:
* __Keep it simple:__ Don't create solutions to impress customers, make the solutions easy enough to use and widely accessible.
* __Do not reinvent the wheel:__ Try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available.
* __Think and act horizontally:__ Companies tend to scale up vertically by centralising operations, but if you want to be agile to deal with immense customer diversity, you need to scale out horizontally.
