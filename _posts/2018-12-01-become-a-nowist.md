Before the proliferation of the Internet, the traditional innovation model was slow and costly, involving MBA's developing a plan, securing venture capital, procuring infrastructure, and finally the hiring of designers and engineers. Now however, the traditional innovation model has been turned on its head and is now a designer and engineer driven model, with funding and scaling following successful deployment and interest in small scale products.

Key messages:
* __Deploy or Die:__ You have to build and get the stuff into the real world for it to really count.
*  __Pull over Push:__ Pull resources as you need it rather than trying to stockpile everything beforehand.
* __Learning over Education:__ Learning is what you do to yourself; education is what others do to you. Learning how to learn is more important than "getting an education".
* __Compass over Maps:__ The cost of writing a full plan or mapping everything out in this complex world is getting so expensive that it is not very useful and often, it is not possible to have planned everything beforehand.

In this age, you do not have to plan everything, stock everything and be so prepared. Focus instead on being connected, always learning, fully aware and fully present.
